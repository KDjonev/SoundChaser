# SoundChaser
SoundChaser is an app designaded tp create a unique, easy to use exercsise expirience in which a path is radomly generated
for particular custmizable peratmiters. We utilize the google maps API and our custom algorithm to achieve this goal. In
end, the navigation system will also be revolutionaty. it will use the sound of your music to navigate you based on fadeing in
each ear.

**HOW TO USE**
Apon launching SoundChaser, you have the settings bar at the top which you can use to view and cange your profile, view your
past runs (TODO), change your settings (TODO) and read the help menu (TODO).

The actual app involes clicking on the "Start Activity" BUtton. Upon doing so, you enter the distance you wish to run (in
Kilometers), the radius you wish to stay within (in applicable, in Kilometers again), as well as if you wish to chose your own 
custom destinaton or not.

Upon clicking "Start activity" if no custom destination is selected, you will start your activity at the current possition, and end
at the same postion. the randomly generated path will take that into account and create the path from start to finish.

if instead you chose to check the custom destinatiom. when you click start activity, you will be promted with a google map, where
you can either enter an adress, or click on the map itself.

if you enter an adress, click Done, and the adress should show up on the map with a finish flag to mark it's position. if this
is the correct address you wish to have as your destination, click "confrim and generate", and your path shall be created to start 
from your current location, to that destination. (TODO).

If instead you wish to click on the map and select your destination visually, once you have a destination, click "confirm and 
generate". and your path shall be created to start from your current location, to that destinatuon. (TODO).

Next, you will be chasing the sound and navigated through the path. (MAJOR TODO)/
